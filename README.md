# Tanzanian_Water_Pumps

This repository originally was for the Lambda School Machine Learning unit build week. The original notebook is named [tanzanian_water_pump_original](tanzanian_water_pump_original.ipynb) and has not been updated with more advanced methodologies. Fortunately, this dataset has excellent pedagogical qualities, therefore I use it for a variety of articles.
